Join us on the 27th March to hear [Shazia Ruybal Pes√°ntez](https://github.com/shaziaruybal) showcase [PGEforge](https://mrc-ide.github.io/PGEforge), a centralized, open-access repository for malaria genomic data analysis including analysis workflows, software evaluations, and reproducible tutorials. 

In this talk, Shazia will present the functionalities of PGEforge, including real-world applications of genomic data use cases and analysis workflows, our approach to reproducible tutorials, and how we built this community-driven resource at a hackathon event using Quarto!
